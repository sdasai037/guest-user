                <p>Designed for Louis Vuitton by Virgil Abloh, and inspired by vintage basketball sneakers, the LV Trainer sneaker is an icon of the shoe collection. This version comes in Monogram denim and features a velcro strap with injected Monogram Flowers.
                    - Avoid contact with water, any substance containing alcohol (perfumes, solvents etc.) or oil (makeup), and abrasive products in general. If shoes have been in contact with water, it is important to allow them to dry thoroughly on shoe trees before cleaning them.<br>
                    - It is important to allow your sneakers to air naturally, and to this end they possess a removable in-sock. If your sneakers become wet, simply remove the in-sock and leave them to dry in a cool, well-ventilated place. This will ensure additional comfort when they are next worn.<br><br>
